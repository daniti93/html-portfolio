<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello, I'm Danit Doron, a recent graduate with a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from Ort Brauda collage, Karmiel. 
  I'm currently in the process of seeking my first junior position in the field.</p>
<p> As part of my ongoing learning journey, I'm enrolled in the fullstack online course, and I'm actively building a portfolio to showcase the projects I complete during this course. 
  This portfolio is an essential component of my professional development and job search strategy.</p>
<p> In my portfolio, I aim to convey a professional image and demonstrate my capabilities to potential employers.
